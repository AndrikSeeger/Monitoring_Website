## Responsive Layout
The layout of the website is fully responsive way down to small devices like older smartphones. It automatically adapts to the given screen size and resolution. It handles the portrait format as well as the landscape format for all supported screens.

An exemplary video of the website displayed on a simulated smartphone screen in portrait mode:
